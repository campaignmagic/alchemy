### The first time you access the blog:

On "the command line" or Terminal on a Mac, navigate to the folder in which you want to store a copy of our site! 

	cd ~/Documents/Folder_Name

	git clone https://github.com/campaignmagic/campaignmagic.github.io.git

This will download all the files related to our site! 

All of our blog posts are stored in a folder called "_posts." Each file is technically, a "markdown" file. Markdown is technically a language for easily formatting or addressing up a text file. You can convert a markdown file into an HTML file quite easily (our site actually does that bit automatically.)

### Writing New Blog Posts

For new blog posts, open up a text editor (Like Sublime, Atom or even TextEdit). 

Every file as to be saved in the following format:

	YYYY-MM-DD-Title-title.md

(The title bit can vary as you please, but put hypens between words. The "build system" we're using to produce the site will be picky about this!)

Each .md post file has a bunch of text called "front matter" at the beginning. It looks like this:

```

title:  "This is an example."

```

You should change the title and date (and category, if you'd like). The actual content of your blog will go below the last three dashes.
