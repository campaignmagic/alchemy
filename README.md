# Alchemy: A Video Game about Privacy

*Alchemy* is a game about what happens when your secrets catch up to you. It follows the character of Franklin, who is an inquisitive dabbler in the science and magic of his day. He concocts potions and balms and elixirs. His creations are made to help his fellow man, but he’s edging closer to a bigger discovery that may make some powerful people unhappy: a recipe to turn lead to gold.  

Franklin’s world is watching. It quietly observes Franklin’s actions, collecting his decisions and habits and feeding them into an opaque algorithm that dispenses punishments and rewards based on seemingly arbitrary information. Who the game thinks Franklin is and who it thinks his friends are will become critical to his survival.
