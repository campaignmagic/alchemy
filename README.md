# Campaign: A Video Game about Politics + Privacy

*Campaign* is a video game about American political campaigns. The project is funded by a Magic Grant from the Brown Institute of Media Innovated and supported in part by ProPublica. We hope to use this space to share what we are learning about political campaigns and game development and to provide a level of transparency for our reporting and design decisions.
